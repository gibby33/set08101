		<p>
		When baking a cheesecake, it is important not to over bake it. You only want to
		bake it until the middle has a slight wiggle, not until is it rock solid.
		</p>
		<p>It is important that you use a water bath, discussed at the right, to ensure
		even baking of your cheesecake.</p>
	<aside>
		To create a water bath, use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling water that
		goes halfway up the spring form pan in which the cake is placed.
