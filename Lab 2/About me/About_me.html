		<title>About me - FGC </title>
	</head>
	<body>
		My main hobby is taking part in the video game sub-community called the Fighting Game Community or FGC for short.
		My local get together is at the <a href="https://www.thesummoners.co.uk/">The Summoner's </a>e-sport bar. Drinks are expensive.
		<br>
		I generally enjoy all fighting games to a degree. Please see the list below for links to various games I play.
